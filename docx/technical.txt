3. Disk Partitioning?
-> It is an Indispensable task during installation of an OS. It consists dividing physical drive into portions being named as "Partitions"
-> File System enbles data storage organization on Physical space. Each Operating System has its own supported File Systems
	Windows: NFS, FAT, exFAT
	Linux Distros: Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, btrfs, XFS, ReiserFS, JFS, ZFS, Bcachefs
-> From Understanding: Order Matters here
	Physical Drive is Partitioned                - Disk Partition 
	Then File Systems are Employed on top of     - File Systems (data processing operations are invovled and data storage management)
